Currently, I teach Introductory modules in Maths and Physics to freshmen in the [School of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine](https://www.agrariamedicinaveterinaria.unipd.it/en/). I also teach a section of the module <b>Advanced Topics in Statistical Mechanics</b>, which is a PhD course for graduate students in Physics.

If you have questions about my modules, you should contact me via email; if you are looking for lecture notes, exercises or workshops of my modules, all the relevant material will be posted on [Moodle](https://elearning.unipd.it/scuolaamv/)

This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.
