I studied Theoretical Physics at the [University of Trieste](http://www-dft.ts.infn.it) (Italy), where I discussed a MSc dissertation on Quantum Computation.

In 2007 I earned my PhD in Physics at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it) (Italy). During my PhD some open fundamental questions in Biology and Ecology fascinated me, so I decided to start studying Theoretical Ecology with a Statistical Mechanics approach. Then I moved to [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu) (USA), where I was Research Associate and I studied macroecological patterns on river topologies as well as spreading of diseases.

In 2009 I moved to the [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk) (UK) as Research Fellow. Here I developed mathematical methods to upscale and downscale biodiversity information and studied stochastic partial differential equations of biological interest.

Since 2012 I have been a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics in the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths) at the University of Leeds.

In 2016 I was invited as a Visiting Fellow of the [Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.newton.ac.uk) (Cambridge) in the programme ["Stochastic Dynamical Systems in Biology: Numerical Methods and Applications"](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/sdb). Here are some of the most interesting and intriguing [seminars](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/sdb/seminars).

In 2019 I moved to the Unversity of Padova as Associate Professor in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy "G. Galileo"](https://www.dfa.unipd.it) where I work in the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://www.liphlab.com) in collaboration with Prof. Amos Maritan and Prof. Samir S. Suweis.
