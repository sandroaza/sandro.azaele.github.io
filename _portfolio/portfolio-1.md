We are currently recruiting PhD students and Post-Docs (starting early 2023). If you have a solid background in Mathematics or Physics and have a strong interest in Statistical Mechanics, Stochastic Processes, Disordered Systems, etc., applied to Biological Systems, then this is the right Lab for you.

Post-doctoral candidates who are able to carry out active multidisciplinary research in any of the broad areas of Statistical Physics, Data Analysis or Numerical Simulations are strongly encouraged to apply. 

Check what we do in the [Lab](https://www.liphlab.com/#research) and get in touch with me!
